​Where are the files? 
https://github.com/vvasuki/sanskritnlp/tree/master/src/main/stardict-sanskrit/sa-head/amara-onto

In particular: dict_deva.dict.dz

How to install?
​Look at screenshots and instructions by shrI ajita - www.aupasana.com/stardict ( which has several other useful dictionaries ) .

​Caveat:
You are expected to take advantage of "auto-complete​" in your stardict-compatible app to find the entry you seek  (stardict demands that there be no collisions among headwords), and you are expected to type in देवनागरी .

​How was this generated?
Thanks to data and code obtained from Smt Amba Pradeep​, modified slightly for our purposes ( https://github.com/vvasuki/sanskritnlp/tree/master/src/main/perl/uohyd/scl-master/amarakosha )
